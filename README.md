This includes scripts used for manuscript and a shiny app used for data exploration before the manuscript was written. The scripts for data processing and figure generation are identified separately. The dataframes used for the manuscript were updated compared to the datafiles used for the app creation.

This is for the shinyapp to explore SCOPE ProMo data. app.R is the app file to run the program. It is hosted as shinyapp.io html webpage. Plotting_Mortality_0923.csv and PercentError_0923.csv are datafiles necessary for running the app. Within R studio, the app can be run in R or R studio using the function shiny::runAPP().

You can find the app at: https://j1beatty.shinyapps.io/mort_shiny/
